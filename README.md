Ultrasn0w fixer 1.1.5 was developed by unknown hackers who made it for iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS unlock. The iPhone Dev-Team is expected to update ultrasn0w accordingly in a couple of days. If you don’t desperately need the unlock solution now, we would recommend you wait for the iPhone Dev-Team’s full solution. However, if that isn’t an option download and install ultrasn0w fixer, and you should be good to go.
